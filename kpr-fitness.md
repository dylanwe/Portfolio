# 🏋️‍♀️ KPR-fitness 
KPR-fitness is a site where you can buy personal training and fitness and food programs. This was the first site made for a real client.

## 👨‍💻 How I made it
The design was made in Adobe XD and coded in PHP. I used Bootstrap to make it responsive and used a database to load all products and make it easier to add new ones.
  
The payments are done with [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/). Mollie is easy to use and has great documentation. With Mollie, I was able to add support for many Dutch banks and make paying easy and comfortable for the customer. The site was made with PHP which Mollie supports so making a payment is as easy as this:

## 👨‍🏫 What I learned
- [x] Using PHP and loading items from a database
- [x] Sending E-mails from a contact form with PHP
- [x] Using a payment system in this case *Mollie*
  
## 📌 What I would do differently
If I had to remake this I would remake the design as I find it looks a bit empty and I didn't capture the mood of a gym and working out.
  
I would add a shopping cart to improve the user experience and make an admin panel so the owner can easily add new items.
